    <p>For the first activity this week I decided to work on activity two, which was to send, receive and respond to email. I can’t lie, I found this activity to be slightly comical given the nature of the world as is right now. A lot of us have been sending emails since grade school. But I did find the tutorial to be very well thought out and easy to understand. One of the best parts about it was the section on how to format an email. I feel like that’s something that’s overlooked often, even in a more formal environment such as with work emails. But understanding the basics of sending and receiving emails will never not be crucial for proper and clear communication.</p>
    <p>For the second activity I decided to look at activity four, viewing message headers. If the amount of spam and phishing attempts in my email weren’t indication enough, its important to know how to use email safely.  Truth be told I actually didn’t know you could view a spoofed email, i always assumed that you couldn’t fake an email address. Being given this insight is defiantly helpful though as anything that seems a bit too fishy I now have just a little bit of extra defense for myself.</p>
    <p>For the third activity this week io decided to do activity one which tasked me with review some social networks and decide which of the sites interested me the most. For this out of the list available I decided to check out Whatsapp. Honestly there wasn’t too much to write home about. The UI of Whatsapp was simple enough but overall it seemed like a simple messaging app. Personally I use an app called Telegram for this purpose but never the less, having the experience with this application is still nice to have.</p>
    <p>Finally for the last activity for this week I decided to do activity number one, where I reviewed different internet services. I enjoyed the way that the site broke up the different services into Communication, Web and information retrieval.  It really helped keep things organized as to which service did what. </p>
