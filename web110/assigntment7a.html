    <p>For my final project I am going to focus on concepts learned in session six. These concepts will cover Graphics, Multimedia and Web Accessibility. Given the nature of the topic I feel there is a lot to be learned that may have been overlooked due to the pace of the classroom. Pairing this with the fact that I just find the concept interesting as far as design goes. Being able to properly entice a user to explore your website and remain interested with good design is a crucial responsibility of any web designer and developer. I hope after all is said and done I also expand my own knowledge of the subject.</p>
    <p>This weeks assignment had us taking a look at project management. In all honesty I was a bit surprised to see we were covering this topic given that this was more of web design class. But the value on the lesson isnâ€™t completely lost on me either. Often time when it comes to design you will have to meet deadlines and its important to go into it with a gameplan so being able to manage your time effectively is crucial. Also being able to show a proper timeline to a client is also very important. It was interesting to see different ways to manage your time however as I had never heard of a Gnatt chart before.</p>
