    <p>For the first activity this week I decided to work on activity number three which was to verify Internet connectivity. Understanding how to make sure that we are online when we need to be may seem like a simple task at first, but anyone that has ever had to call up Xfinity customer service because they can’t get a connection to watch the newest episode of their favorite show online may say otherwise. Being able to self-diagnosis basic internet connectivity issues should be something most of us know how to do these days. While reading the lights on the modem or router sound easy enough a lot of the time being able to identify what a blinking light means is the difference between waiting for an update and a 45-minute-long phone call to tech support. Although sometimes the issues may go deeper than just making sure all the correct lights are on your device. Sometimes you just can’t reach the site you need to, in moments like that being able to identify if you can truly connect to the host of that site will prove extremely valuable. That’s where the ping command will play a huge role in detecting where your connectivity issues lie. Maybe you have a connection online but that specific site may be down or maybe you aren’t connected to your works VPN. Again, while basic, having these fundamental understandings will prove invaluable.</p>
    <p>For the second activity this week I decided to work on activity number seven, which to research and describe the requirements to set up a home network for ourselves. I found this one interesting because depending on the individual’s needs your home network can be vastly different. For instance, the nocturnal gamer (myself) will have very different network needs versus the person who just browses Instagram on their phone. To set up our home network we are going to need a few things. The first being an ISP to provide our living space with connection to the internet.  After that’s done (and assuming the wiring in the home is done correctly) we are going to need a router/modem. In most cases this will be provided by the ISP and be a combination of the two. For the sake of the example we will say the modem provides sufficient Wi-Fi coverage for our home but if it did not we could use repeaters in areas that need a bit of a boost. Now seeing as this is my home network and I do not require the use of any VPNs I, in theory should be able to directly connect my computer to my modem via ethernet and have access to the internet.</p>
