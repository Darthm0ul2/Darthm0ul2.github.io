    <h2 class="class1">Assignment 5B Learning Summary</h2>
    <p style="color: coral;">This part of the assignment proved a bit more challenging than I initially anticipated Mostly due to the fact of the different combinations you can get into when it comes to customizing your website.  After doing a bit of research I found ways to set classes to certain portions of my website and also on how to make a combination of customizations to one portion. I may not have a eye for design myself given the way a lot of my custom colors came out but overall I think things came out ok.  Currently the website is starting to actually feel like it has some thought behind it and Iâ€™m looking forward to see what else can be done with it.</p>
