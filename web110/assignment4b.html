    <p> For the first activity this week I chose to complete activity two, practicing web browser safety. I use the Opera browser so that’s the one I chose to look at. Opera already has some built-in features into the browser that I can take advantage of. One of which was the built in Ad Blocker. I previously was using an extension for this, but having a first party version of it may do me better.  One issue with ad blockers is that companies can sometimes find ways to ensure that they do not work as intended. Twitch for instance basically makes my ad blocker useless. But it seems that’s Operas version of the ad blocker works perfectly.  I also enjoyed that they had a section that went over all of the different security symbols you may see in your address bar.  I knew what some of them meant such as “secured connection” and “camera access” but being given a rundown on the rest of the symbols was very helpful. </p>
    <p>For the second activity I chose to work on activity number three, using anti-malware software to scan my system. For this activity I used Malwarebytes. My computer has been due for a good scan. The scan took quite a while to complete because I chose to do a complete scan versus a quick one. After some time, my results came back and luckily for me no malware was detected. I try my best not to click malicious links or visit unsavory sites. Any downloads I have io get from trusted sources, so I wasn’t too surprised.  I also set the application up to do automatic scans once a week just to make sure that I’m doing what I can to keep things running smoothly. Some people say that Windows defender is good enough and you don’t need an antivirus/malware scanner if you’re smart but in my opinion its still very good to have. </p>
