    <p>For the first activity this week I decided to do activity number two which involved installing multiple web browsers to compare them.  For most of us we typically will find one browser that we find convenient or the “flavor of the month” and continue to use them until the next best thing comes out or need to use a different browser because our favorite program doesn’t work with our current one. I happen to be one of these individuals. Luckily for me however, I actually already had a few of these web browsers installed but I primarily use google chrome.  While at work we typically only can use Edge. Edge to me doesn’t “feel” good to use and Firefox just doesn’t seem like it has anything special to write home about.  Google Chrome has been my browser of choice due to the sleek nature of it. However after installing more browsers I have sense switched over to Opera(GX). I had seen advertisements for this browser before so now was a good a time as any to give it a shot.  Without trying to hard to sound like a walking advertisement I do truly enjoy a lot of the features that Opera has. Two of the main ones being the ability to limit the number of resources the browser uses and the other just being the fact it runs on Chromium so all of my passwords and settings can easily be transferred over. So, while having the experience of these different browsers is nice, it still comes down to personal preference and decided what you may or may not make use of. </p>
    <p>For the second activity I decided to do activity number five which was to configure the browsers extensions and add-ons. The fact that Opera(GX) runs on Chromium made these very simple to get them formatted to a place I like with their import feature. However, I did take the opportunity to take a look over some of the extensions I had installed. I noticed that quite a few of them were either out of date or correlated to some niche event I needed to use it for that one time. This was mostly a cleaning house opportunity to me because making sure I don’t have any unnecessary programs/addons running ensure not only do I keep my computer running nicely but helps avoid malicious attacks for having out of date software. Some of the most popular extensions I use are AD-Block and Grammarly. Opera already has built in password managers so that’s extremely convenient.</p>
