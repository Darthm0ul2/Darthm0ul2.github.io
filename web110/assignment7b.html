    <p>Doing the activity this week was a throw back to the first time I had worked on SQL. It was a nice reminder of the ways you can go about finding information quickly using SQL. I don’t personally enjoying trying to find a lot of the information without the use of a database tool, the process is very tedious. At some point I decided to use one , so I broke the rules slightly. But the core concepts were still there for me I believe. Databases are a great way to store information and are crucial to staying organized depending on your line of work.</p>
