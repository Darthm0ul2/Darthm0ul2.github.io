<p>This project taught me a lot about computer graphics and im happy I had the opportunity to learn more about it. While I wish we had a bit more time to really sit down and focus on things I think over all the core concepts still stuck. This project did take some work on very little time so things feel a bit more tough than I would like. My favorite portion of the project was learning more about vector and raster imaging, I truly didnâ€™t know there was a difference between the two at first and assumed every thing was pixel based with raster imaging.</p>
