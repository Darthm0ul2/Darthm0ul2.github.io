    <p>Doing this portion of this weeks assignment I found myself having a lot of fun with. Its very enjoyable seeing my own website kind of come to life in away. I had a few issues with getting the hyperlinks to work properly but after some additional research and consulting I figured out where I was going wrong.  In all honesty this wasn’t as difficult as I was first imaging, granted we are still keeping things relatively simple but for the most part this hasn’t been anything to pull my hair out over. I’m hoping that this trend continues as we get into more advanced concepts.
