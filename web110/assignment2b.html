    <p>For the first activity this week I decided to activity two where I compared search engines. I decided to compare Google, Yahoo, and Bing.  The search I ran was “What happened today”. This was a relatively simple search that I believed all the engines could handle. Upon looking at the results however I noticed that while Yahoo and Bing gave me the same top result based on what I searched but Google gave a completely different website. In fact the top result for the two other webpages were ranked pretty low on the Google side of things. I’m not quite sure what that  means in terms of relevancy or reliability of the search but it was interesting to see none the less.  Also in terms of the UI itself it felt like Yahoo and Bing had a lot of extra content on their search pages, which in my opinion made everything look too “busy”. After looking up the search engine market share, Google being my preferred browser I wasn’t too surprised to see that they owned 90% of the market. Google is a household name and has always been THE search engine to use in my experience. </p>
    <p>For the second activity this week I decided to do activity number six, which was to use the Internet Archive. All too often we hear the phrase “once its on the internet its there forever” and the fact that we have an archiving website just makes that statement even more powerful. Using the Wayback Machine offers and interesting look at the internet past. From websites I used to browse as a kid all the way down to obsolete tutorials. Its astonishing just how extensive the archive has grown with over 866 Billion web pages saved and to think that’s not even a fraction of the entirety of the internet, things really get put into perspective.</p>
