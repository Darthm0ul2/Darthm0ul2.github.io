    <p>For the first activity this week I decided to complete activity number one which was a list of different tutorials and documents going over internet basics ranging from connection types, ISPs and search engines. While this specific activity may not have been the most advanced, I cannot stress the importance of having a solid foundation when it comes to this sort of thing. Given the nature of the course I found this activity at the very least to be a solid form of review. One section of the activity I particularly enjoyed was going over how users connect to the internet.  For the less informed they may not think more than the fact that they pay their internet bill, and the magic router box lets them connect to Facebook or YouTube.  But I found a way that the activity was able to summarize just how each “cog in the system” worked together to perform that feat.  Whether you connect using dial-up or satellite, having at least a basic understanding of something that I use on a daily basis seems useful to have just as general knowledge.</p>
        <p>For the second activity I decided to go with activity number four and review how to manage folders and files. This activity served more as a confirmation that the way I currently save and organize my files is adequate. One major takeaway I did get from this activity is the importance of subfiles. Unfortunately, I currently find myself constantly making new folders to hold information that may be being used for the same project or activity I’m working on.  This has caused issues for me in the past when it comes to just efficiency in finding what I’m looking for. While I may have my own personal opinions on Linux as an operating system itself (I hate it), being bale to quickly and accurately get into different file systems will be crucial to my future development.
