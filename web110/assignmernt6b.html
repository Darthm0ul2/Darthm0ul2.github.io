    <p>Going through the process of verifying my links offered more information than I originally thought it would. While the sites themselves work perfectly fine, the validators offered additional insight in ways to make sure that they were optimized. For instance, it let me know when I was using an obsolete way of bordering my video for the webpage. It also gave some handy tips on just cleaning up my code, weather that was from having a extra  space or a misaligned bracket. Also the housekeeping tip of making sure my ALT text was labeled  properly offered good hindsight as well.</p>
