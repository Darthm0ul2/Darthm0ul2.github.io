    <p>For the first part of the activity this week I was able to upload an AI image to our webpage, embedded a YouTube video and also was able to upload an audio clip to my website as well. Over all there was quite a lot of good information during the lesson. I really took interesting in the iframes portion. While in initially confusing at first after some additional research I learned that for videos you have to use the special embed link and not just copy the URL as it will be unable to work. I feel like Iâ€™m slowly grasping a better understanding of all of the aspects that go into making a website.</p>
